- Contributed to the successful integration of Velocity Black – The Ultimate Members Club, a high-end eCommerce app recently acquired to expand Capital One’s digital offerings. [App Store link][download-vb]{:target="\_blank"}
- Provided technical guidance to an engineering team and contributed with new features built using Swift, async/await and GCD for performing network requests, Combine for reactive programming, and Cocoapods as dependency manager for reusable third-party libraries such as Alamofire, TrustKit, Stripe SDK, Lottie-ios, Firebase Analytics, RxSwift, among others.
- Successfully released to the public a new feature that enables cardholders to access exclusive experiences as part of the card's benefits. Translated requirements and broke down complex features into technical tasks to implement reusable components such as dashboards, rewards trackers, and transaction lists, following Apple’s guidance and best practices. Adhered to VIPER and MVVM architecture patterns to ensure clean, testable, maintainable, and robust code.
- Fostered collaboration with cross-functional teams including designers, product owners, and fellow technical leads to align technical efforts with stakeholder expectations, surface dependencies early, and efficiently coordinate delivery of upcoming features on schedule.
- Led the design and implementation of a Python-based microservice deployed as an AWS Lambda function to support seamless transaction display across multiple credit cards in the iOS banking app. During early deployment, I identified and resolved performance issues caused by large data payloads and inefficient UI components. Improvements included implementing caching, pagination, and optimizing cell rendering. I also added unit tests to prevent regressions and ensure long-term stability.
- Integrated LLM’s Sentiment Analysis microservice (hosted on Django and Flask) to summarize customer reviews inside the credit card home screen, highlighting trending and popular credit card perks and benefits.
- Used Cursor, an AI-powered development tool, to iteratively prototype and refine new features, progressively making changes and fixes until achieving end-to-end, almost close to production-ready solutions in a short timeframe.
- Designed and implemented Jenkins and Fastlane and CI/CD pipelines scripts to automate testing, building, code signing, and publishing of pre-release versions via TestFlight, enabling Beta users to identify and report regression issues prior to App Store submission.
- Ensured ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) compliance across banking app features by leveraging Apple’s Accessibility APIs in UIKit and SwiftUI to enhance usability for users with disabilities.
- Improved unit test coverage by 20% for a key component by integrating GitHub Copilot into the IDE, enabling faster development of robust, reusable code and expanded test scenarios.
