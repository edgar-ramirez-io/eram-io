Welcome to my very first blog. My name is Edgar Ramirez and I am a front-end software engineer working for more than 10 years in different industries. The purpose of this blog is to share more about my experience and the work that I have done so far. I hope this is helpful for you and that you can learn something from me.

Enjoy it!
